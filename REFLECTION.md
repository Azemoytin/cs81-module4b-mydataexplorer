# Reflection

  1. Were your predictions right?
     - Most screen time: I predicted Thursday, and Thursday was the highest screenTime at 7.0 hours.
     - Best focus day: I predicted Wednesday, and Wednesday had the highest focusLevel of 9.
     - Caffeine effect: As expected, since I don't take caffiene it did not  did not yield a higher focus.

  2. What surprised you?
     I was surprised that my sleep during the weekend didnâ€™t result in the highest focus. Instead, the week days were more important.

  3. What was tricky or rewarding?
     Creating the correlateCaffeineToFocus function was rewarding. It reinforced grouping data and averages. It also helped to predict the data beforehand to focus the analysis.

  4. How did using your own data change things?
     Using personal data made the exercise more engaging because I could immediately relate to my actual life habits, which made the functions feel practically useful.
